    "**Raw reads are imperfect** due to presence of primer and adapter sequences from WTA2, Nextera library prep,... and because NGS inherently produces some errors during base calling. The quality of such a base call gets encoded in a FASTQ file as a [PHRED-score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phred_quality_score#:~:text=The%20FASTQ%20format%20encodes%20phred,efficacy%20of%20different%20sequencing%20methods.). This also means that the raw reads have to be filtered and trimmed for these imperfections. We can do this by using software (eg. Trimmomatic, cutadapt, etc.) that will trim the reads based on base call quality and the presence of adapter sequences provided by the user. However, also after trimming your reads, it is best to check the quality of you samples.\n",

    "- **SLIDINGWINDOW**:<i>\\<windowSize>:\\<requiredQuality> </i><br />Perform a sliding window trimming, cutting once the average quality within the window falls below a threshold. By considering multiple bases, a single poor quality base will not cause the removal of high quality data later in the read. \n",
    "- **LEADING**:<i>\\<quality> </i> <br />Cut bases off the start of a read, if below a threshold quality\n",
    "- **TRAILING**:<i>\\<quality> </i> <br />Cut bases off the end of a read, if below a threshold quality\n",
