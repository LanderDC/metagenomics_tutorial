This repository is intended as a learning tool for new PhD-students, master students, interns, etc. The main jupyter notebook gives an overview of the commands needed for the primary analysis of raw NGS data, flavoured with explanations and neat tips & tricks. Basic command-line knowledge is required to be able to complete this tutorial, a Linux introduction course like [this one](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/) should suffice.

This tutorial can be followed by running the commands directly from the terminal or within the jupyter notebook. To run a jupyter notebook on the gbiomed teaching server, copy it to the `~/data/jupyternotebooks/` folder and open an internet browser to navigate to [bmw.gbiomed.kuleuven.be](https://bmw.gbiomed.kuleuven.be/), log in with your KU Leuven credentials and then you should be able to run the notebook. You can find more information on how to transfer files to a remote server in the main notebook. Jupyter notebooks can also be provided to the students as html-files.
