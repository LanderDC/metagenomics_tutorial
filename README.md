This repository is intended as a learning tool for new PhD-students, master students, interns, etc.

This tutorial can be followed by running the commands directly from the terminal or within the jupyter notebook. To run a jupyter notebook on the teaching server, copy it to the `~/data/jupyternotebooks/` folder and open an internet browser to navigate to [bmw.gbiomed.kuleuven.be](bmw.gbiomed.kuleuven.be), log in with your KU Leuven credentials and then you should be able to run the notebook. You can find more information on how to transfer files to a remote server in the [pipeline notebook](pipeline.ipynb).
